# arduino-workshop

This repository contains all required files for an Arduino workshop.
The workshop is held at the makerspace Eigenbaukombinat Halle. The used
language is German but I hope I can document most parts in English too.

## Folders

### Demonstrators

DXF files for CNC machined parts used by the various demonstrators.

## Diagrams

Circuit diagrams made in Fritzing used in the slides.

### Sketches

All the sketches/examples for the Arduino IDE used in the workshop.

### Slides

The slides for the workshop are prepared in HTML and rendered using reveal.js.
Custom images we made can be found in the folder Slides/img.
